This C code implements a simple Tic Tac Toe game with a basic AI opponent.
The board is represented as a 3x3 array of characters, initially filled with empty spaces.
Players take turns to make moves, either 'X' for the user or 'O' for the AI.
The game checks for a winner after each move by examining rows, columns, and diagonals.
If there is no winner and the board is full, the game ends in a tie.
